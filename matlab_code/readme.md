# Matlab code

You can use **img_test_and_save.m** to test the PSNR between ground truth pictures and the bicubic pictures(the pictures generated by downsample and upsample ground truth picture with bicubic interpolation).

But you need to do a little word before use it:

Rename one of  the two file **normal_generate_bicubic_and_test.m** and **abnormal_generate_bicubic_and_test.m** to **PSNR.m**, **PSNR.m** will be used to calculate the PSNR.

**normal_generate_bicubic_and_test.m** calculate the PSNR in the same way as SRCNN, get the result 33.6614. The calculation process is illustrated in flowchart 1.

**abnormal_generate_bicubic_and_test.m ** calculate the PSNR in a different way, get the result 33.6529. The calculation process is illustrated in flowchart 2.

Running **img_test_and_save.m** will save the bicubic pictures at current path. You can use these pictures and ground truth pictures to calculate PSNR by running **read_exist_img_test.m**.

The bicubic pictures made by matlab with double type and uint8 type have been put in **./double** and **./uint8** respectively, the details are shown in **img_test_and_save.m**.
