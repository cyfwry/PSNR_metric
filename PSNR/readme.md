# Calculate PSNR

Put the ground truth pictures in **./gt** and Put the test pictures in **./img**.

The name of the picture pair(ground truth picture and test picture) must be the same.(In fact, the name of the ground truth picture must be included in the test picture)

You can run **bicubic.py** to test the PSNR between the ground truth pictures and its bicubic pictures(the pictures generated by downsample and upsample ground truth picture with bicubic interpolation), which will not use the pictures in **./img**.

You can run **PSNR.py** to test the PSNR between the ground truth pictures and the test pictures.

The keys to calculate PSNR correctly in python are these two things:

1. You need to use **round()** before changing the type to uint8 when transform RGB/BGR to YCrCb.

2. You need to change the type to double before calculating PSNR.

These can also been seen in the flowchart.
