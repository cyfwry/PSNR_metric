# PSNR_metric
Calculating PSNR is a very important task in super-resolution research because PSNR is one of the most commonly used metrics. But early researchs were all on matlab, also including the code to calculate PSNR and preprocess(bicubic downsample and upsample). As most of the current mainstream deep learning frameworks are based of python, I need to re-write the calculating PSNR and preprocess code in python.
Thanks to the work in https://github.com/fatheral/matlab_imresize, it successfully reproduces the function $imresize()$ in Matlab. This code is used to downsample and upsample the picture. And I found out that, the reproduction code is very successful when dealing with double type, but there are some problems when dealing with uint8 type(I only test the part of bicubic). The reason is still unknown yet. 
My code for calculating PSNR is based on the code of matlab version in http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html.
Later I will draw a flowchart about calculating PSNR and put it on github.
